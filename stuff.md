### What comes around

[*God helps those, who help themselves.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helps_those_who_help_themselves#:~:text=The%20phrase%20%22God%20helps%20those,inspire%20people%20for%20self%2Dhelp.); there are infinite (uni|multi)verses at our fingertips, but also "above" us, in a recursive manner. Whatever we do affects the the verses "below" that at one point comes to a full circle back to us. God (or "a" god) is above is (representation, intentions, etc are irrelevant) so if we do something they will get affected (and us, subsequently), while the actions resonate.

Like the gossip-game, but what is the source of original actions? In such a setup, aren't these always just a reaction to a previous action?

### untitled

(At least) 2 parallel story lines:

+ line 1: A guided tour to for a group of influential people to introduce a couple of "remarkable individuals".

+ line 2: Classic superhero stuff with team-ups, etc.

Bottom line: the "remarkable individuals" are stir crazy patients who can actively share their imagination and fantasies with each other, creating their own bubble universe insider their collective heads.

(Maybe comic or other visual format would be best?)
